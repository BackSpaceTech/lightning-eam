The custom folder contains user customizations.

The lists folder contains user customizable lists. You can modify lists with low risk of application damage.

There is also a folder in client/templates/application for custom templates and a folder at lib/collections/custom for custom methods.
**** Custom templates and methods pose a high risk of damaging the application and data integrity. Use lists where possible ****

When upgrading application all customizations will need to be saved and re-applied and tested after upgrade.
