#The Lightning EAM Project




A project to create the World's fastest Enterprise Asset Management System capable of handling big data while at the same time using a modern user interface accessible from mobile devices.


##About


The Lightning EAM project is a revolutionary approach to managing asset data. The core ideal is to break down the myths surrounding Enterprise Asset Management created by corporations with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. This enables us to start with a clean slate and select the best performing technologies that can handle modern asset information requirements such as big data and mobile.
